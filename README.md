## Adaptive OS Scheduler for Real-Time Systems

## Overview
This project implements an adaptive scheduling system for real-time operating systems, dynamically adjusting task priorities based on deadlines and system workload. The scheduler enhances CPU utilization, reduces deadline misses, and improves system responsiveness.

## Problem statement 
Real-time operating systems (RTOS) require efficient scheduling mechanisms to ensure tasks meet their deadlines while maintaining optimal CPU utilization. Traditional static scheduling algorithms, such as Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF), may fail under varying workloads, leading to missed deadlines, inefficient resource utilization, and system instability.

To address these challenges, an Adaptive OS Scheduler is needed to dynamically adjust task priorities based on real-time system load and deadlines. The scheduler should preemptively allocate CPU resources, minimize deadline misses, and provide performance insights through visualization tools.

This project aims to develop an adaptive scheduling system that enhances system responsiveness, CPU efficiency, and real-time task execution, making it suitable for mission-critical applications such as embedded systems, industrial automation, and autonomous systems.

## Key Features
- **Task Management** – Stores tasks with execution time, priority, and deadlines.
- **Adaptive Scheduling** – Supports Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS).
- **Dynamic Priority Adjustment** – Modifies priorities in real time based on system load.
- **Preemptive Scheduling** – Ensures real-time execution with minimal response delay.
- **Performance Analysis** – Generates Gantt charts, evaluates CPU efficiency, and compares adaptive vs. static scheduling.
